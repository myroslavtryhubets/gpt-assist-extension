GPT-Assist Extension
====================

GPT-Assist is a browser extension that helps users seamlessly generate text suggestions using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model while they are typing on any web input field or textarea. The extension is designed to be easy-to-use, fast, and unobtrusive.

**Note**: Currently, the extension does not support Google Docs due to its custom content-editable div and iframe implementation.
